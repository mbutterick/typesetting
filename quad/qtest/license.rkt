1. I, Matthew Butterick (d/b/a MB Type), own the fonts delivered with this license. Below, these are called "my fonts". The person who bought this license is the "license buyer". The humans designated by the license buyer to use my fonts are the "licensed users".

1. This license is non-exclusive and non-transferable. It takes effect when the fonts are delivered to the license buyer. I reserve all rights not granted below.

1. Licensed users can be employees or human contractors of the license buyer. If the license buyer is human, the license buyer themselves can be a licensed user, as can immediate family members (e.g., spouse, parent, child, sibling) of the license buyer. Others—cousins, roommates, corporate entities, internet randos—cannot be designated as licensed users. 

1. The maximum number of licensed users is determined by whatever size license was purchased by the license buyer. The license buyer can change who's designated as a licensed user, as long as the total doesn't exceed this maximum.
Subject to the limitations below, licensed users can install my fonts on any computing devices, or any accounts on multi-user computing devices, dedicated exclusively to them. Licensed users can use my fonts in any way they like, including printed documents, logos, and commercial products.

1. Licensed users who are employees or contractors of the license buyer can use my fonts only for projects on behalf of the license buyer. Likewise, anyone who uses my fonts for projects on behalf of the license buyer needs to be a licensed user.

1. Copies of my fonts cannot be distributed to those who are not licensed users. Nor can my fonts be stored in a location accessible to those who are not licensed users (e.g., a file server or GitHub repo). 

1. But my fonts can be embedded as follows—

1. Read-only copies of my fonts can be embedded in digital files, including PDFs, e-books, apps, and websites (as webfonts). "Read-only" means that those who use these digital files can neither install my fonts nor use them to make new documents. Webfont usage is allowed on up to three domains owned by the license buyer.
Read–write copies of my fonts can be embedded in word-processing documents that will be shared with fewer than 20 people.

1. These embedding rights don't extend to digital files or websites that will be owned or primarily used by third parties (e.g., your clients, if you are a designer or developer). They need a separate license. This restriction doesn't apply to documents prepared for clients of legal services (e.g., letters and court filings).
Licensed users can modify my fonts, including converting them to other formats. My copyright and trademark notices must remain intact. Modified fonts can be shared with other licensed users. The same license terms apply to the modified fonts. No technical support is available for modified fonts.

1. This license remains in effect until terminated. 

1. The license buyer can terminate this license by sending me a written request along with confirmation that that all copies of my fonts, including embedded copies, have been deleted. If this request is made within 30 days of the license order, I'll refund the license fee.

1. If the license buyer or any licensed user breaches this license, it will automatically terminate.

1. If the license buyer or any licensed user has unusual or excessive technical-support needs, I can terminate the license by refunding the license fee. 

1. None of my descriptions of my fonts are legal advice.

1. California law governs this license. Courts in Los Angeles County, California have exclusive jurisdiction over claims arising under this license. The license buyer agrees to service of process at the email address on the original order.

1. **IMPORTANT!** My fonts are offered on an "as is" basis. The license buyer assumes the entire risk of the quality and performance of my fonts, and waives both the implied warranty of fitness and the implied warranty against infringement of third-party rights.

1. **ALSO IMPORTANT!** My liability for costs, damages, or other losses arising from use of my fonts under this license—including third-party claims—is limited to a refund of the license fee.
This is the whole license. If part of the license turns out to be unenforceable, the rest will remain. This license can be changed only if the license buyer & I agree in writing. 

1. Questions? Email [mb@mbtype.com](mailto:mb@mbtype.com). Thank you for your purchase. Enjoy the fonts.
