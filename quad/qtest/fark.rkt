## 1. Welcome to Racket

Depending on how you look at it, **Racket** is

* a _programming language_—a dialect of Lisp and a descendant of Scheme;

  > dialects of Lisp and how they relate to Racket.

* a _family_ of programming languages—variants of Racket, and more; or

* a set of _tools_—for using a family of programming languages.

Where there is no room for confusion, we use simply _Racket_.
