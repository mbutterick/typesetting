" This " (block '(no-break #t) "is some truly") " nonsense generated from my typesetting system, which is called Quad. I’m writing this in a source file in DrRacket. When I click [Run], a PDF pops out. Not bad\u200a—\u200aand no LaTeX needed. Quad, however, does use the fancy linebreaking algorithm developed for TeX. (It also includes a faster linebreaking algorithm for when speed is more important than quality.) Of course, it can also handle " (block '(font "Courier") "different fonts,") (block '(style italic) " styles, ") (word '(size 14.0 weight bold) "and sizes-") " within the same line. As you can see, it can also justify paragraphs."))
