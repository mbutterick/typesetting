Hands up: who likes working with binary formats?

OK, just a few of you, in the back. You're free to go. 

As for everyone else: Xenomorph eases the pain of working with binary formats. Instead of laboriously counting bytes —

@itemlist[#:style 'ordered
@item{You describe a binary format declaratively by using smaller ingredients — e.g., integers, strings, lists, pointers, dicts, and perhaps other nested encodings. This is known as a @deftech{xenomorphic object}.}

@item{This xenomorphic object can then be used as a binary encoder, allowing you to convert Racket values to binary and write them out to a file.}

@item{But wait, there's more: once defined, this xenomorphic object can @emph{also} be used as a binary decoder, reading bytes and parsing them into Racket values.}
]

So one binary-format definition can be used for both input and output. Meanwhile, Xenomorph handles all the dull housekeeping of counting bytes (because somebody has to).

This package is derived principally from Devon Govett's @link["https://github.com/devongovett/restructure"]{@tt{restructure}} library for Node.js. Thanks for doing the heavy lifting, dude.


@section{Installation}

At the command line:

@verbatim{raco pkg install xenomorph}

After that, you can update the package from the command line:

@verbatim{raco pkg update xenomorph}

@subsection{A binary format for complex numbers}

Racket natively supports @tech{complex numbers}. Suppose we want to encode these numbers in a binary format without losing precision. How would we do it?

First, we need to understand Racket's recipe for a complex number:

@itemlist[
@item{A @tech{complex number} has a @tech{real part} and an @tech{imaginary part}. The coeffiecient of each part is a @tech{real number}.}

@item{A @tech{real number} is either a @tech{floating-point} number or an @tech{exact} number.}

@item{An @tech{exact number} is a rational number, that is, a number with a @tech{numerator} and @tech{denominator}.}

@item{The @tech{numerator} and @tech{denominator} can each be an arbitrarily large signed @tech{integer}.}

]

To make a binary format for complex numbers, we build the format by composing smaller ingredients into bigger ones. So we'll work the recipe from bottom to top, composing our ingredients as we go.

@subsubsection{Big integers}

Let's start with the big integers. We can't use an existing signed-integer type like @racket[int32] because our big integers won't necessarily fit. For that matter, this also rules out any type derived from @racket[x:int%], because all xenomorphic integers have a fixed size.

Instead, we need to use a variable-length type. How about an @racket[x:string]? If we don't specify a @racket[#:length] argument, it can be arbitrarily long. All we need to do is convert our number to a string before encoding (with @racket[number->string]) and then convert string to number after decoding (with @racket[string->number]).


@interaction[#:eval my-eval
(define bigint (x:string #:pre-encode number->string
                         #:post-decode string->number))

(define abigint (- (expt 2 80)))
abigint
(encode bigint abigint #f)
(decode bigint #"-1208925819614629174706176\0")
]

@subsubsection{Exact numbers}

Next, we handle exact numbers. An exact number is a combination of two big integers representing a numerator and a denominator. So in this case, we need a xenomorphic type that can store two values. How about an @racket[x:list]? The length of the list will be two, and the type of the list will be our new @racket[bigint] type.

Similar to before, we use pre-encoding to convert our Racket value into an encodable shape. This time, we convert an exact number into a list of its @racket[numerator] and @racket[denominator]. After decoding, we take that list and convert its values back into an exact number (by using @racket[/]):

@interaction[#:eval my-eval
(define exact (x:list #:type bigint 
                      #:length 2
                      #:pre-encode (λ (x) (list (numerator x) (denominator x)))
                      #:post-decode (λ (nd) (apply / nd))))
(encode exact -1234/5678 #f)
(decode exact #"-617\0002839\0")
]

@subsubsection{Real numbers}

A real number is either a floating-point number (for which we can use Xenomorph's built-in @racket[float] type) or an exact number (for which we can use the @racket[exact] type we just defined).

This time, we need an encoder that allows us to choose from among two possibilities. How about an @racket[x:versioned-dict]? We'll assign our exact numbers to version 0, and our floats to version 1. (These version numbers are arbitrary — we could pick any two values, but a small integer will fit inside a @racket[uint8].)

We specify a @racket[#:version-key] of @racket['version]. Then in our pre-encode function, we choose the version of the encoding based on whether the input value is @racket[exact?].

@interaction[#:eval my-eval
(define real (x:versioned-dict
              #:type uint8
              #:version-key 'version
              #:versions
              (list
               (cons 0 (list (cons 'val exact)))
               (cons 1 (list (cons 'val float))))
              #:pre-encode (λ (num) (list (cons 'val num)
                                          (cons 'version (if (exact? num)
                                                             0
                                                             1))))
              #:post-decode (λ (h) (hash-ref h 'val))))
(encode real 123.45 #f)
(decode real #"\1f\346\366B")
(encode real -1/16 #f)
(decode real #"\0-1\00016\0")
]

Notice that the float loses some precision during the encoding & decoding process. This is a natural part of how floating-point numbers work — they are called @tech{inexact} for this reason — so this is a feature, not a bug.

@subsubsection{Complex numbers}

Now we put it all together. A complex number is a combination of a real part and an imaginary part, each of which has a real coefficient. Therefore, we can model a complex number in a binary format just like we did for exact numbers: as a list of two values.

Once again, we use a pre-encoder and post-decoder to massage the data. On the way in, the pre-encoder turns the complex number into a list of real-number coefficients with @racket[real-part] and @racket[imag-part]. On the way out, these coefficients are reformed into a complex number through some easy addition and multiplication.


@interaction[#:eval my-eval
(define complex (x:list #:type real
                        #:length 2
                        #:pre-encode (λ (num) (list (real-part num) (imag-part num)))
                        #:post-decode (λ (ri) (+ (first ri) (* +i (second ri))))))
(encode complex 123.45-6.789i #f)
(decode complex #"\1f\346\366B\1}?\331\300")
(encode complex 1/234-5/678i #f)
(decode complex #"\0001\000234\0\0-5\000678\0")
]


@section{The big picture}

@subsection{Bytes and byte strings}

Suppose we have a file on disk. What's in the file? Without knowing anything else, we can at least say the file contains a sequence of @deftech{bytes}. A @tech{byte} is the smallest unit of data storage. It's not, however, the smallest unit of information storage — that would be a @deftech{bit}. But when we read (or write) from disk (or other source, like memory), we work with bytes. 

A byte holds eight bits, so it can take on values between 0 and 255, inclusive. In Racket, a sequence of bytes is also known as a @deftech{byte string}. It prints as a series of values between quotation marks, prefixed with @litchar{#}:

@racketblock[#"ABC"]

Caution: though this looks similar to the ordinary string @racket["ABC"], we're better off thinking of it as a block of integers that are sometimes displayed as characters for convenience. For instance, the byte string above represents three bytes valued 65, 66, and 67. This byte string could also be written in hexadecimal like so:

@(racketvalfont "#\"\\x41\\x42\\x43\"")

Or octal like so:

@(racketvalfont "#\"\\101\\102\\103\"")

All three mean the same thing. (If you like, confirm this by trying them on the REPL.)

We can also make an equivalent byte string with @racket[bytes]. As above, Racket doesn't care how we notate the values, as long as they're between 0 and 255:

@examples[#:eval my-eval
(bytes 65 66 67)
(bytes (+ 31 34) (* 3 22) (- 100 33))
(apply bytes (map char->integer '(#\A #\B #\C)))
]

Byte values between 32 and 127 are printed as characters. Other values are printed in octal:

@examples[#:eval my-eval
(bytes 65 66 67 154 206 255)
]

If you think this printing convention is a little weird, I agree. But that's how Racket does it. 

If we prefer to deal with lists of integers, we can always use @racket[bytes->list] and @racket[list->bytes]:

@examples[#:eval my-eval
(bytes->list #"ABC\232\316\377")
(list->bytes '(65 66 67 154 206 255))
]

The key point: the @litchar{#} prefix tells us we're looking at a byte string, not an ordinary string.


@subsection{Binary formats}

Back to files. Files are classified as being either @deftech{binary} or @deftech{text}. (A distinction observed by Racket functions such as @racket[write-to-file].) When we speak of binary vs. text, we're saying something about the internal structure of the byte sequence — what values those bytes represent. We'll call this internal structure the @deftech{binary format} of the file.

@margin-note{This internal structure is also called an @emph{encoding}. Here, however, I avoid using that term as a synonym for @tech{binary format}, because I prefer to reserve it for when we talk about encoding and decoding as operations on data.}

@;{
@subsubsection{Text encodings}

Text files are a just a particular subset of binary files that use a @deftech{text encoding} — that is, a binary encoding that stores human-readable characters. 

But since we all have experience with text files, let's use text encoding as a way of starting to understand what's happening under the hood with binary encodings.

For example, ASCII is a familiar encoding that stores each character in seven bits, so it can describe 128 distinct characters. Because every ASCII code is less than 255, we can store ASCII text with one byte per character.

But if we want to use more than 128 distinct characters, we're stuck. That's why Racket instead uses the UTF-8 text encoding by default. UTF-8 uses between one and three bytes to encode each character, and can thus represent up to 1,112,064 distinct characters. We can see how this works by converting a string into an encoded byte sequence using @racket[string->bytes/utf-8]:

@examples[#:eval my-eval
(string->bytes/utf-8 "ABCD")
(bytes->list (string->bytes/utf-8 "ABCD"))
(string->bytes/utf-8 "ABÇ战")
(bytes->list (string->bytes/utf-8 "ABÇ战"))
]

For ASCII-compatible characters, UTF-8 uses one byte for each character. Thus, the string @racket["ABCD"] is four bytes long in UTF-8. 

Now consider the string @racket["ABÇ战"], which has four characters, but the second two aren't ASCII-compatible. In UTF-8, it's encoded as seven bytes: the first two characters are one byte each, the @racket["Ç"] takes two bytes, and the @racket["战"] takes three.

Moreover, for further simplicity, text files typically rely on a small set of pre-defined encodings, like ASCII or UTF-8 or Latin-1, so that those who write programs that manipulate text only have to support a smallish set of encodings.


@subsubsection{Binary encodings}



@subsubsection{In sum}

Three corollaries follow:

@itemlist[#:style 'ordered
@item{A given sequence of bytes can mean different things, depending on what encoding we use.}

@item{We can only make sense of a sequence of bytes if we know its encoding.}

@item{A byte sequence does not describe its own encoding.}

]

For those familiar with programming-language lingo, an encoding somewhat resembles a @deftech{grammar}, which is a tool for describing the syntactic structure of a program. A grammar doesn't describe one particular program. Rather, it describes all possible programs that are consistent with the grammar, and therefore can be used to parse any particular one. Likewise for an encoding.

@margin-note{Can a grammar work as a binary encoding? In limited cases, but not enough to be practical. Most grammars have to assume the target program is context free, meaning that the grammar rules apply the same way everywhere. By contrast, binary files are nonrecursive and contextual.}

@section{Core xenomorphic objects}

These basic xenomorphic objects can be used on their own, or combined to make bigger xenomorphic objects.

Note on naming: the main xenomorphix objects have an @litchar{x:} prefix to distinguish them from (and prevent name collisions with) the ordinary Racket thing (for instance, @racket[x:list] vs. @racket[list]). Other xenomorphic objects (like @racket[uint8]) don't have this prefix, because it seems unnecessary and therefore laborious.

@defclass[x:base% object% ()]{

When making your own xenomorphic objects, usually you'll want to stick together existing core objects, or inherit from one of those classes. Inheriting from @racket[x:base%] is also allowed, but you have to do all the heavy lifting.

@subsection{Numbers}

@defmodule[xenomorph/number]

@defproc[
(endian-value?
[val any/c])
boolean?]{
Whether @racket[val] is either @racket['be] (representing big endian) or @racket['le] (representing little endian).
}


@defthing[system-endian endian-value?]{
The endian value of the current system. Big endian is represented as @racket['be] and little endian as @racket['le]. This can be used as an argument for classes that inherit from @racket[x:number%]. 

Use this value carefully, however. Binary formats are usually defined using one endian convention or the other (so that data can be exchanged among machines regardless of the endianness of the underlying system).

@margin-note{When an integer is more than one byte long, one has to consider how the bytes are ordered. If the byte representing the lowest 8 bits appears first, it's known as @emph{little endian} byte ordering. If this byte appears last, it's called @emph{big endian} byte ordering. 

For example, the integer 1 in 32-bit occupies four bytes. In little endian, it would be encoded as @racket[#"\1\0\0\0"]. In big endian, as @racket[#"\0\0\0\1"].

When encoding and decoding binary formats, one has to be consistent about endianness, because it will change the meaning of the binary value. For instance, if we inadvertently treated the big-endian byte stream @racket[#"\0\0\0\1"] as little endian, we'd get the result @racket[16777216] instead of the expected @racket[1].

@subsection{Dicts}

@defmodule[xenomorph/dict]

A @deftech{dict} is a store of keys and values. The analogy to a Racket @racket[dict?] is intentional, but in Xenomorph a dict must also be @emph{ordered}, because a binary encoding doesn't make sense if it happens in a different order every time. The more precise analogy would be to an @tech{association list} — a thing that has both dict-like and list-like qualities — but this would be a laborious name. 

@defclass[x:dict% x:base% ()]{

The rest arguments determine the keys and value types of the dict. These arguments can either be alternating keys and value-type arguments (similar to the calling pattern for @racket[hasheq]) or @tech{association lists}.

@racket[pre-encode-proc] and @racket[post-decode-proc] control the pre-encoding and post-decoding procedures, respectively. Each takes as input the value to be processed and returns a new value.

@subsection{Versioned dicts}

@defmodule[xenomorph/versioned-dict]


The versioned dict is a format derived from @racket[x:dict%] that contains multiple possible dict encodings. It also carries a version field to select among them. This version is stored with the encoded data, of course, so on decode, the correct version will be chosen.


@defproc[

Each key of @racket[versions] must be a value consistent with @racket[type], and each value must either be a @racket[dict?] or @racket[x:dict?].

@racket[version-key] identifies the key that should be treated as the version selector. By default, it's a separate private key called @racket[x:version-key] that exists independently of the data fields. But if one of the existing data fields should be treated as the version key, you can pass it as the @racket[version-key] argument. 

@racket[pre-encode-proc] and @racket[post-decode-proc] control the pre-encoding and post-decoding procedures, respectively. Each takes as input the value to be processed and returns a new value.

@subsection{Pointers}

@defmodule[xenomorph/pointer]

A pointer can be thought of as a meta-object that can wrap any of the other binary formats here. It doesn't change how they work: they still take the same inputs (on @racket[encode]) and produce the same values (on @racket[decode]).

What it does change is the underlying housekeeping, by creating a layer of indirection around the data.

On @racket[encode], instead of storing the raw data at a certain point in the byte stream, it creates a reference — that is, a @deftech{pointer} — to that data at another location, and then puts the data at that location. 

On @racket[decode], the process is reversed: the pointer is dereferenced to discover the true location of the data, the data is read from that location, and then the decode proceeds as usual.

Under the hood, this housekeeping is fiddly and annoying. But good news! It's already been done. Please do something worthwhile with the hours of your life that have been returned to you.

Pointers can be useful for making data types of different sizes behave as if they were the same size. For instance, @secref{Lists} require all elements to have the same encoded size. What if you want to put different data types in the list? Wrap each item in a pointer, and you can make a list of pointers (because they have consistent size) that reference different kinds of data.
