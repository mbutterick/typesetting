@title{Xenomorph: binary encoding & decoding}

@author[(author+email "Matthew Butterick" "mb@mbtype.com")]

@margin-note{This package is in development. I make no commitment to maintaining the public interface documented below.}

@defmodule[xenomorph]

Hands up: who likes working with binary formats?

OK, just a few of you, in the back. You're free to go. 

As for everyone else: Xenomorph eases the pain of working with binary formats. Instead of laboriously counting bytes —

@itemlist[#:style 'ordered
@item{You describe a binary format declaratively by using smaller ingredients — e.g., integers, strings, lists, pointers, dicts, and perhaps other nested encodings. This is known as a @deftech{xenomorphic object}.}

@item{This xenomorphic object can then be used as a binary encoder, allowing you to convert Racket values to binary and write them out to a file.}

@item{But wait, there's more: once defined, this xenomorphic object can @emph{also} be used as a binary decoder, reading bytes and parsing them into Racket values.}
]

So one binary-format definition can be used for both input and output. Meanwhile, Xenomorph handles all the dull housekeeping of counting bytes (because somebody has to).

This package is derived principally from Devon Govett's @link["https://github.com/devongovett/restructure"]{@tt{restructure}} library for Node.js. Thanks for doing the heavy lifting, dude.


@section{Installation}

@section{The big picture}

@subsection{Bytes and byte strings}

Suppose we have a file on disk. What's in the file? Without knowing anything else, we can at least say the file contains a sequence of @deftech{bytes}. A @tech{byte} is the smallest unit of data storage. It's not, however, the smallest unit of information storage — that would be a @deftech{bit}. But when we read (or write) from disk (or other source, like memory), we work with bytes. 

A byte holds eight bits, so it can take on values between 0 and 255, inclusive. In Racket, a sequence of bytes is also known as a @deftech{byte string}. It prints as a series of values between quotation marks, prefixed with @litchar{#}:

@racketblock[#"ABC"]

Caution: though this looks similar to the ordinary string @racket["ABC"], we're better off thinking of it as a block of integers that are sometimes displayed as characters for convenience. For instance, the byte string above represents three bytes valued 65, 66, and 67. This byte string could also be written in hexadecimal like so:

@(racketvalfont "#\"\\x41\\x42\\x43\"")

Or octal like so:

@(racketvalfont "#\"\\101\\102\\103\"")

Both of these mean the same thing. (If you like, confirm this by trying them on the REPL.)

We can also make an equivalent byte string with @racket[bytes]. As above, Racket doesn't care how we notate the values, as long as they're between 0 and 255:

@examples[#:eval my-eval
(bytes 65 66 67)
(bytes (+ 31 34) (* 3 22) (- 100 33))
(apply bytes (map char->integer '(#\A #\B #\C)))
]

Byte values between 32 and 127 are printed as characters. Other values are printed in octal:

@examples[#:eval my-eval
(bytes 65 66 67 154 206 255)
]

If you think this printing convention is a little weird, I agree. But that's how Racket does it. 

If we prefer to deal with lists of integers, we can always use @racket[bytes->list] and @racket[list->bytes]:

@examples[#:eval my-eval
(bytes->list #"ABC\232\316\377")
(list->bytes '(65 66 67 154 206 255))
]

The key point: the @litchar{#"} prefix tells us we're looking at a byte string, not an ordinary string.


@subsection{Binary formats}

Back to files. Files are classified as being either @deftech{binary} or @deftech{text}. (A distinction observed by Racket functions such as @racket[write-to-file].) When we speak of binary vs. text, we're saying something about the internal structure of the byte sequence — what values those bytes represent. We'll call this internal structure the @deftech{binary format} of the file.

@margin-note{This internal structure is also called an @emph{encoding}. Here, however, I avoid using that term as a synonym for @tech{binary format}, because I prefer to reserve it for when we talk about encoding and decoding as operations on data.}

@;{
@subsubsection{Text encodings}

Text files are a just a particular subset of binary files that use a @deftech{text encoding} — that is, a binary encoding that stores human-readable characters. 

But since we all have experience with text files, let's use text encoding as a way of starting to understand what's happening under the hood with binary encodings.

For example, ASCII is a familiar encoding that stores each character in seven bits, so it can describe 128 distinct characters. Because every ASCII code is less than 255, we can store ASCII text with one byte per character.

But if we want to use more than 128 distinct characters, we're stuck. That's why Racket instead uses the UTF-8 text encoding by default. UTF-8 uses between one and three bytes to encode each character, and can thus represent up to 1,112,064 distinct characters. We can see how this works by converting a string into an encoded byte sequence using @racket[string->bytes/utf-8]:

@examples[#:eval my-eval
(string->bytes/utf-8 "ABCD")
(bytes->list (string->bytes/utf-8 "ABCD"))
(string->bytes/utf-8 "ABÇ战")
(bytes->list (string->bytes/utf-8 "ABÇ战"))
]

For ASCII-compatible characters, UTF-8 uses one byte for each character. Thus, the string @racket["ABCD"] is four bytes long in UTF-8. 

Now consider the string @racket["ABÇ战"], which has four characters, but the second two aren't ASCII-compatible. In UTF-8, it's encoded as seven bytes: the first two characters are one byte each, the @racket["Ç"] takes two bytes, and the @racket["战"] takes three.

Moreover, for further simplicity, text files typically rely on a small set of pre-defined encodings, like ASCII or UTF-8 or Latin-1, so that those who write programs that manipulate text only have to support a smallish set of encodings.


@subsubsection{Binary encodings}



@subsubsection{In sum}

Three corollaries follow:

@itemlist[#:style 'ordered
@item{A given sequence of bytes can mean different things, depending on what encoding we use.}

@item{We can only make sense of a sequence of bytes if we know its encoding.}

@item{A byte sequence does not describe its own encoding.}

]

For those familiar with programming-language lingo, an encoding somewhat resembles a @deftech{grammar}, which is a tool for describing the syntactic structure of a program. A grammar doesn't describe one particular program. Rather, it describes all possible programs that are consistent with the grammar, and therefore can be used to parse any particular one. Likewise for an encoding.

@margin-note{Can a grammar work as a binary encoding? In limited cases, but not enough to be practical. Most grammars have to assume the target program is context free, meaning that the grammar rules apply the same way everywhere. By contrast, binary files are nonrecursive and contextual.}

@section{Core xenomorphic objects}

These basic xenomorphic objects can be used on their own, or combined to make bigger xenomorphic objects.

Note on naming: the main xenomorphix objects have an @litchar{x:} prefix to distinguish them from (and prevent name collisions with) the ordinary Racket thing (for instance, @racket[x:list] vs. @racket[list]). Other xenomorphic objects (like @racket[uint8]) don't have this prefix, because it seems unnecessary and therefore laborious.

@defclass[x:base% object% ()]{

When making your own xenomorphic objects, usually you'll want to stick together existing core objects, or inherit from one of those classes. Inheriting from @racket[x:base%] is also allowed, but you have to do all the heavy lifting.

@subsection{Streams}

@defmodule[xenomorph/stream]

Under the hood, just a wrapper around the @racket[x:list%] class that produces a stream rather than a list. 

The distinguishing feature of a @tech{stream} is that the evaluation is lazy: elements are only decoded as they are requested (and then they are cached for subsequent use). Therefore, a Xenomorph stream is a good choice when you don't want to incur the costs of decoding every element immediately (as you will when you use @secref{Lists}).

@subsection{Dicts}

@defmodule[xenomorph/dict]

A @deftech{dict} is a store of keys and values. The analogy to a Racket @racket[dict?] is intentional, but in Xenomorph a dict must also be @emph{ordered}, because a binary encoding doesn't make sense if it happens in a different order every time. The more precise analogy would be to an @tech{association list} — a thing that has both dict-like and list-like qualities — but this would be a laborious name. 

@defclass[x:dict% x:base% ()]{
Base class for dict formats. Use @racket[x:dict] to conveniently instantiate new dict formats.

@defconstructor[
([fields dict?])]{
Create class instance that represents a dict format with @racket[fields] as a dictionary holding the key–value pairs that define the dict format. Each key must be a @racket[symbol?] and each value must be a @racket[xenomorphic?] type.

@subsection{Versioned dicts}

@defmodule[xenomorph/versioned-dict]


The versioned dict is a format derived from @racket[x:dict%] that contains multiple possible dict encodings. It also carries a version field to select among them. This version is stored with the encoded data, of course, so on decode, the correct version will be chosen.


@defproc[
(version-type?
[x any/c])

Whether @racket[x] can be used as the version type of a versioned dict. Valid types are @racket[integer?], @racket[procedure?], @racket[xenomorphic?], or @racket[symbol?].

@racket[pre-encode-proc] and @racket[post-decode-proc] control the pre-encoding and post-decodeing procedures, respectively.

@racket[base-class] controls the class used for instantiation of the new object.   
}


@subsection{Pointers}

@defmodule[xenomorph/pointer]

A pointer can be thought of as a meta-object that can wrap any of the other binary formats here. It doesn't change how they work: they still take the same inputs (on @racket[encode]) and produce the same values (on @racket[decode]).

What it does change is the underlying housekeeping, by creating a layer of indirection around the data.

On @racket[encode], instead of storing the raw data at a certain point in the byte stream, it creates a reference — that is, a @deftech{pointer} — to that data at another location, and then puts the data at that location. 

On @racket[decode], the process is reversed: the pointer is dereferenced to discover the true location of the data, the data is read from that location, and then the decode proceeds as usual.

Under the hood, this housekeeping is fiddly and annoying. But good news! It's already been done. Please do something worthwhile with the hours of your life that have been returned to you.

Pointers can be useful for making data types of different sizes behave as if they were the same size. For instance, @secref{Lists} require all elements to have the same encoded size. What if you want to put different data types in the list? Wrap each item in a pointer, and you can make a list of pointers (because they have consistent size) that reference different kinds of data.



@defclass[x:pointer% x:base% ()]{
Base class for pointer formats. Use @racket[x:pointer] to conveniently instantiate new pointer formats.

@defproc[
(pointer-relative-value?
