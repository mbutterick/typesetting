## Project status

Actively developed though I’m not sure what more will be done. Everything from `restructure` has been ported over. Mostly this package supports [Quad](https://github.com/mbutterick/quad), so I don’t expect it will have a meaningful life as a standalone library. Moreover nobody seems to like binary formats.
