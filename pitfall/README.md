## pitfall

Racket library for generating PDFs. Based on [PDFKit](https://github.com/devongovett/pdfkit).

## Project status

Actively developed, though it’s not clear what more needs to be done. Most of the functionality from PDFKit has been ported over. This project is built to support [Quad](https://git.matthewbutterick.com/mbutterick/typesetting/src/branch/main/quad). I have no plans to release it as a standalone library or write documentation. In truth, I don’t know how a lot of this code works.
