## fontland

Racket library for messing with fonts. Based on [`fontkit`](https://github.com/foliojs/fontkit).


## License


MIT (code)

Fonts in `assets` folder are under separate licenses included there.


## Project status

Actively developed, but this package exists entirely to support [`pitfall`](https://git.matthewbutterick.com/mbutterick/typesetting/src/branch/main/pitfall) and [`quad`](https://git.matthewbutterick.com/mbutterick/typesetting/src/branch/main/quad). I have no ambition to make this a standalone library with documentation. I add things opportunistically based on whatâ€™s happening with Quad.
