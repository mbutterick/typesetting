## Project status

Unclear. The code works well, but I built this library thinking it would be useful for a certain project and then it turned out I didn’t need it. I haven’t abandoned it. But I also haven’t gotten it to a 1.0 release. And I don’t want to, unless I’m developing it in service of a larger project, because that tends to be the best way to reveal bugs and misbegotten thinking.
