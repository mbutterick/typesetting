"""Markov Decision Processes (Chapter 17)

First we define an MDP, and the special case of a GridMDP, in which
states are laid out in a 2-dimensional grid.  We also represent a policy
as a dictionary of {state:action} pairs, and a Utility function as a
dictionary of {state:number} pairs.  We then define the value_iteration 
and policy_iteration algorithms."""

    state/action/state triplet, we instead have T(s, a) return a list of (p, s')
